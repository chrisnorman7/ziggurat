# Ziggurat

This package allows you to build audio games with Dart.

It started out as tools for making maps, but has since expanded to provide a
general set of APIs for making audio games.

## Sounds

Please note that since version 0.50.0, Ziggurat both generates and handles sound
events. There is no longer any need for the
[ziggurat_sounds](https://pub.dev/packages/ziggurat_sounds) package, and this
will be deprecated.
