# Ziggurat

This package allows you to build audio games with Dart.

It started out as tools for making maps, but has since expanded to provide a
general set of APIs for making audio games.

## Sounds

Please note that to generate actual sounds, you will need to use the [ziggurat_sounds](https://pub.dev/packages/ziggurat_sounds), and this package will only generate sound events.
